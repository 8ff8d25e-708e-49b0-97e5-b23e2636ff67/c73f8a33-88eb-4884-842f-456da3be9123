If the lesion is found incidentally—that is, during routine check-ups or while diagnosing a condition initially unrelated to adrenal dysfunction—it is referred to as an incidentaloma. The detected lesion may turn out to be a benign change that does not affect bodily function, a hormonally active lesion that secretes adrenal hormones (e.g., cortisol), or a malignant tumor.
